Given a set of videos containing human subjects speaking some predefined but unknown phrases, the task is to cluster the related videos. Relatedness would be defined by two factors - speech content and pose. A key detail about the videos would be the presence of visemically equivalent phrases such as billion and million.Clustering in speech videos is a relatively unexplored problem, and this task, in our opinion, would yield innovative architectures as well as interesting insights to solve the problem.   To make things more interesting the words which are spoken will be informed thus helping you know the correct number of clusters required. The task will be done in 2 stages:  Stage-1: It will consist of samples from OuluVS2. Clustering needs to be performed on all the 10 phrases of Oulu VS-2. Test videos IDs can be accessed from here. Stage-2: It will consist of samples from LRW dataset. The teams who qualify Stage-1 will be sent the details of this task
